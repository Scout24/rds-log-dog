rds-log-dog  [UNMAINTAINED]
===========

rds-log-dog is a tool to automatically feed your [AWS RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/de/rds/) logfiles into your monitoring solutions.
It should reduce the manual effort in accessing the log files from your RDS intances.
You can now define, how long you want to store your database logfiles (in s3).

After installing the tool, all your logfiles of your RDS instances (of one region) will be automatically fetched into a s3 bucket and stored around 90 days.

The repo is not maintained any more, because there is no use for it from our side.

How does it work?
=================

Overview
--------

The logfiles of your AWS RDS instances will be automatically stored in a s3 bucket (default starts with: rds-log-dog).
From there you can feed the logfiles into you ELK stack or other monitoring/logging solutions.


How to install it?
================

Clone it:

     git clone git@github.com:ImmobilienScout24/rds-log-dog.git

Deploy to your AWS account with:

    ./deploy.sh -cis -p

You need the have aws credentials set in your bash session to deploy! If you set AWS_DEFAULT_REGION, this region will be used to deploy.

Now you have three cloudformation stacks:

- rds-log-dog-s3
- rds-log-dog-lambda
- rds-log-dog-scheduler


How do I use it?
================


After deploying with deploy.sh ...

All things are running automatically. You will find the logfiles of your RDS instances in a s3 bucket named like: 
   
    rds-log-dog-XXXXXXXXXXX/rds_logs/

Alternativly you can collect the logfiles by calling the command line version of the tool:

    rds-log-dog.py


What does it cost ?
===================

With the default configuration and 4 instances with (together) 70MB of logfiles each hour, it will cost you appr. $1.30 per month.
Normal RDS installations have only some KB of logfiles and costs you some cents a month.

How to contribute ?
===================

You will need:

- jq
- python 2.7
- an AWS account

Clone the project with: 

    git clone git@github.com:ImmobilienScout24/rds-log-dog.git

We recommend installing PyBuilder in a [virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/):

    pip install virtualenv
    cd rds-log-dog
    virtualenv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate

Install pybuilder & dependencies:
   
    pip install pybuilder
    pyb install_dependencies

Now you can (locally) build and run tests with:

    pyb 

If you want to test it in your account, try to execute:

    ./deploy.sh -ci -v

This will deploy a personalized stack with your username (1st three chars).
And executing the integration tests.

Running integration tests seperately:

    pyb run_integration_tests

For the integration tests you need the some variables from the deploy.sh in target/. So first run ./deploy.sh.
